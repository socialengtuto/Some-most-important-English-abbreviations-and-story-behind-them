S.O.S is NOT, as is commonly presumed, an abbreviation of Save Our Souls or any other expansion. In fact, it doesn't stand for anything at all. The original distress signal was just the morse code ...---... and this is one symbol in morse code. It does not represent any letter or word as it is not separated by spaces. The translation SOS comes from interpolating the symbol with spaces after every 3 characters.
